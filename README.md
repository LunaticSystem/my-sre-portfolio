# My SRE Portfolio

Welcome to my Site Reliability Engineering portfolio! This repository captures my journey and work in building, scaling, and maintaining reliable software systems.

## 🚀 About This Portfolio

This collection demonstrates my expertise in:
- **Automation & Tooling**: Scripts and tools to eliminate toil.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Modules and configurations for managing cloud resources.
- **System Design**: Projects implementing core SRE principles.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Languages**: Go, Python, Shell, Terraform
- **Tools**: (Add specific tools you use, e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The portfolio is organized into the following sections:

- **[`projects/`](./projects)**: Larger, standalone projects and applications.
    - **[`go/`](./projects/go)**: Go-based projects and tools.
    - **[`python/`](./projects/python)**: Python utilities and automation.
- **[`modules/`](./modules)**: Reusable infrastructure modules (e.g., Terraform, Ansible roles).
- **[`scripts/`](./scripts)**: Handy one-off scripts for system administration and operational tasks.
